# Code Book: Description of the tidy data set variables

Below is the list of variables obtained after the analysis performed by the project of the course Getting and Cleaning Data. The data set contains the means of data sampling made with the Samsung smartphone with respect to 30 subjects on 6 differences activities. All values are based on normalized variables, meaning all initial values were comprised beween -1.00 and 1.00. 

## Subject 

Class = Integer

This variable is the unique identifier of the subject who performed the activity.
30 subject have been Ã¢rt of the experience and are identifiy by interger starting from 1 to 30.

## Activity 

Class = Factor

This variable describes the activity performed by the subject. 6 different activities have been consider and are listed below:

* "LAYING"
* "SITTING"
* "STANDING"
* "WALKING"
* "WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS"
* "WALKING_UPSTAIRS"
