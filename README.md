#The analysis description

## General information

The R script use for the data analysis is "run_analysis.R". This script will load raw data collecting from Samsuns smartphones and transform it in tidy data.

The script "run_analysis.R" use the library dplyr (This library should be installed before launching the script).

## Tasks description

The "run_analysis.R" will execute the tasks below:

 
* Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
* Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
* Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
* Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
* From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
